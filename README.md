# hello-world
This is my first website!

Welcome to AP Computer Science Principles! This is your first assignment.

If you've successfully completed your activity, you can now contribute, create, and manage projects on GitHub!

Below are some alternate tasks in case you want to practice!

Task 1:
Create three different branches. Use them to make three different changes to your website, and commit the one you thing works best!

Task 2:
Add a friend as a contributor on a future project. This means you'll get to accomplish twice as much with twice as many INFINITE ideas and skills!

Task 3:
Could you teach someone else how to create a GitHub account? Create a tutorial similar to the one your instructor provided that got you here. You may need it soon!
